<p>I am an enthusiastic coding novice ready to create interesting projects. Currently, I feel comfortable with HTML and CSS, and am frequently practicing JavaScript in order to improve in that language. I look forward to coding while watching baseball for the next six months.</p>

<p>In my spare time I play with my eight month old baby girl, who happens to be the cutest baby in the world. I also enjoy urban hiking through the beautiful streets of Evanston with my husband and baby, and online shopping.</p>
